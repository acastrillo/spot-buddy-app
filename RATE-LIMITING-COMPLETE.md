# Rate Limiting Implementation - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Status**: ✅ READY TO TEST (Upstash setup required)
**Routes Protected**: 7 API routes
**Testing Script**: Ready

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

I've successfully applied rate limiting to all critical API routes while you set up Upstash. Here's what's ready to go:

### ✅ Routes Protected with Rate Limiting

1. **GET /api/workouts** - 100 requests per minute (read operations)
2. **POST /api/workouts** - 50 requests per minute (write operations)
3. **POST /api/ocr** - 10 requests per hour (expensive OCR processing)
4. **POST /api/instagram-fetch** - 20 requests per hour (Apify costs money)
5. **POST /api/upload-image** - 20 requests per hour (S3 uploads)
6. **POST /api/ai/enhance-workout** - 30 requests per hour (Bedrock AI)

**Total**: 6 routes + 2 methods on /api/workouts = 7 protected endpoints

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Set Up Upstash (5-10 minutes)

Follow the guide I created: **[UPSTASH-SETUP-GUIDE.md](UPSTASH-SETUP-GUIDE.md)**

Quick version:
1. Go to https://upstash.com/ and create account
2. Create Redis database (name: `spot-buddy-rate-limit`)
3. Copy REST URL and token
4. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://us1-caring-fox-12345.upstash.io
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=AX8gASQg...
   ```
5. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

## 🧪 Testing

### Option 1: Automated Testing Script (Recommended)

I created a comprehensive test script that will test all rate limits automatically:

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Login via browser at http://localhost:3000
# 3. Copy your session cookie (see instructions in script)
# 4. Save it to .session-cookie file

# 5. Run the test script
node scripts/test-rate-limits.mjs
```

The script will:
- ✅ Test all 6 rate-limited routes
- ✅ Make limit + 1 requests to each
- ✅ Verify the last request gets 429
- ✅ Check rate limit headers
- ✅ Provide detailed pass/fail report

### Option 2: Manual Testing

**Test Workouts GET (100/minute):**
```bash
# In browser console:
for (let i = 0; i < 101; i++) {
  fetch('/api/workouts')
    .then(r => console.log(`Request ${i+1}: ${r.status}`));
}
# 101st request should return 429
```

**Test OCR (10/hour):**
Use the app UI to upload 11 images for OCR. The 11th should fail with rate limit message.

## 📊 Rate Limit Configuration

All limits are defined in `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`:

| Operation | Limit | Window | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Read** | 100 | 1 minute | Fast, cheap DynamoDB reads |
| **Write** | 50 | 1 minute | More expensive, but common |
| **OCR** | 10 | 1 hour | Very expensive (Textract costs) |
| **Instagram** | 20 | 1 hour | Apify API costs money |
| **Upload** | 20 | 1 hour | S3 costs + potential abuse |
| **AI** | 30 | 1 hour | Bedrock costs ($3/MTok) |

## 🔍 How It Works

### Request Flow

1. User makes request to protected route
2. Auth check (via `getAuthenticatedUserId()`)
3. **Rate limit check** (via `checkRateLimit(userId, operation)`)
4. If under limit: Request proceeds
5. If over limit: Return 429 with headers

### Response Headers

Every request includes rate limit headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 73
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1698765432
Retry-After: 45
```

Client apps can use these to show users their quota status!

### Error Response (429)

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests",
  "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit. Please try again later.",
  "limit": 100,
  "remaining": 0,
  "reset": 1698765432
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### 1. Distributed Rate Limiting
Uses Upstash Redis, so rate limits work across multiple servers/containers.

### 2. Sliding Window Algorithm
More precise than fixed windows. No "burst" exploit where user makes 200 requests at 00:59 and 01:01.

### 3. Fail-Open Design
If Redis is down, requests are allowed (won't break your app). Error is logged for monitoring.

### 4. Per-User Limits
Limits are per `userId`, not per IP. Prevents abuse while allowing multiple devices.

### 5. Retry-After Header
Tells clients exactly when to retry (in seconds).

## 📈 Cost Analysis

### Upstash Free Tier
- **10,000 requests/day** = 300,000/month
- **256 MB storage**
- **FREE**

### Expected Usage (100 active users)
- 100 users × 50 API calls/day = 5,000 requests/day
- **Well within free tier!**

### If You Exceed Free Tier
- **$0.20 per 100,000 requests**
- 500,000 requests/month = **$1/month**
- 1,000,000 requests/month = **$2/month**

**Very affordable!**

## 🚀 Deployment to Production

### AWS ECS Deployment

1. **Add to AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:**
   ```
   Name: /spotter/UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL
   Type: String
   Value: https://us1-caring-fox-12345.upstash.io

   Name: /spotter/UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN
   Type: SecureString (encrypted)
   Value: AX8gASQg...
   ```

2. **Update ECS Task Definition:**
   Add environment variables referencing the parameters above.

3. **Redeploy service**

### Monitoring

Once deployed, monitor in Upstash dashboard:
- Total requests/day
- Command breakdown
- Latency
- Error rates

Set up CloudWatch alarms for:
- High 429 rate (> 10%)
- Redis connection errors

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Rate limiting not working"

**Check:**
1. ✅ Upstash credentials in `.env.local`
2. ✅ Dev server restarted after adding credentials
3. ✅ No errors in server logs
4. ✅ Upstash dashboard shows activity

**Test:**
```bash
# Check environment variables
node -p "process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL"
# Should print your Upstash URL
```

### Issue: "All requests get 429 immediately"

**Possible causes:**
1. Rate limit window too short
2. Multiple tests running simultaneously
3. Shared Redis database with other apps

**Solution:**
- Wait for rate limit window to reset
- Create separate Redis database for testing

### Issue: "No rate limit headers in response"

**Check:**
1. Route has rate limiting code
2. Using correct endpoint
3. Headers are being read (case-sensitive)

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (After Upstash Setup)
1. ✅ Run test script to verify all routes
2. ✅ Check Upstash dashboard for activity
3. ✅ Test in browser with DevTools

### Short-term
1. **Add tier-based limits** - Different limits for free vs pro users
2. **Add analytics** - Track which users hit limits most
3. **Add warnings** - Alert users at 80% quota

### Future Enhancements
1. **Dynamic limits** - Increase limits for trusted users
2. **Cooldown periods** - Temporary bans for repeat offenders
3. **Quota dashboard** - Let users see their usage
