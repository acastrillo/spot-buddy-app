# Phase 2 Implementation: Calendar & Scheduling

**Completion Date**: January 7, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours

## Overview

Phase 2 adds comprehensive workout scheduling capabilities to Spot Buddy, transforming it from a workout tracker into a complete workout planner. Users can now schedule workouts for future dates, mark workouts as completed on specific dates, and view their workout calendar with visual indicators for scheduled vs. completed workouts.

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 2.1 Workout Scheduling System ‚úÖ

**Files Modified**:
- [src/lib/dynamodb.ts](src/lib/dynamodb.ts) - Added scheduling fields and methods
- [src/app/api/workouts/[id]/schedule/route.ts](src/app/api/workouts/[id]/schedule/route.ts) - Schedule/unschedule API
- [src/app/api/workouts/[id]/complete/route.ts](src/app/api/workouts/[id]/complete/route.ts) - Mark as completed API
- [src/app/api/workouts/scheduled/route.ts](src/app/api/workouts/scheduled/route.ts) - Query scheduled workouts

**DynamoDB Schema Updates**:
```typescript
export interface DynamoDBWorkout {
  // ... existing fields

  // Phase 2: Scheduling & Status
  scheduledDate?: string | null;        // ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) when workout is scheduled
  status?: 'scheduled' | 'completed' | 'skipped' | null; // Workout completion status
  completedDate?: string | null;        // ISO date when workout was completed
}
```

**New DynamoDB Methods**:
- `getScheduledForDate(userId, date)` - Get workouts scheduled for a specific date
- `getScheduled(userId)` - Get all scheduled workouts
- `scheduleWorkout(userId, workoutId, scheduledDate, status)` - Schedule a workout
- `completeWorkout(userId, workoutId, completedDate)` - Mark workout as completed
- `unscheduleWorkout(userId, workoutId)` - Remove scheduling info

**Key Features**:
- Schedule workouts for future dates
- Mark workouts as completed on past/current dates
- Track workout status (scheduled, completed, skipped)
- Separate completedDate from createdAt for accurate tracking
- Query workouts by scheduled date

### 2.2 Enhanced Calendar View ‚úÖ

**File**: [src/app/calendar/page.tsx](src/app/calendar/page.tsx)

**Features**:
- Visual indicators for scheduled workouts (hollow ring)
- Visual indicators for completed workouts (filled dot/badge)
- Combined view showing both scheduled and completed workouts on selected date
- Status badges showing "Scheduled" vs "Completed" in workout list
- Real-time updates when workouts are scheduled or completed

**Calendar Markers**:
- **Completed workouts**: Filled dot or number badge (cyan/primary color)
- **Scheduled workouts**: Hollow ring or outlined badge (purple/secondary color)
- **Both**: Combined indicators showing both states

**Selected Date Details**:
- Lists all workouts for selected date (scheduled + completed)
- Shows status badges for each workout
- Click to view workout details
- Responsive layout with stats sidebar

### 2.3 Library Page Scheduling Integration ‚úÖ

**File**: [src/app/library/page.tsx](src/app/library/page.tsx)

**Features**:
- Updated `handleMarkCompleted` to use new scheduling APIs
- Future dates ‚Üí schedules workout via `/api/workouts/[id]/schedule`
- Past/current dates ‚Üí marks as completed via `/api/workouts/[id]/complete`
- Automatic reload after scheduling/completing
- Streak calculation based on completed workouts

**User Flow**:
1. User clicks calendar icon on workout card
2. Selects a date from date picker
3. If future date ‚Üí workout is scheduled
4. If past/current date ‚Üí workout is marked as completed
5. Calendar page automatically reflects changes

### 2.4 API Routes ‚úÖ

**New Endpoints**:

#### `PATCH /api/workouts/[id]/schedule`
Schedule a workout for a specific date
```json
{
  "scheduledDate": "2025-01-15",
  "status": "scheduled"
}
```

#### `DELETE /api/workouts/[id]/schedule`
Unschedule a workout (remove scheduling info)

#### `POST /api/workouts/[id]/complete`
Mark a workout as completed
```json
{
  "completedDate": "2025-01-07"  // Optional, defaults to today
}
```

#### `GET /api/workouts/scheduled?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
Get scheduled workouts
- Without `date` param: returns all scheduled workouts
- With `date` param: returns workouts scheduled for that specific date

### 2.5 Visual Improvements ‚úÖ

**Calendar Component**: Already supported scheduled workouts!
- The [src/components/ui/calendar.tsx](src/components/ui/calendar.tsx) component already had `scheduledDates` and `scheduledCounts` props implemented
- Just needed to wire up the data from DynamoDB

**Status Badges**:
- Scheduled workouts: Purple/secondary color with outlined style
- Completed workouts: Cyan/primary color with filled style
- Clear visual distinction between states

## üìä Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

1. **Scheduling a Workout**:
   ```
   User selects future date ‚Üí Library page calls /api/workouts/[id]/schedule
   ‚Üí DynamoDB updates workout with scheduledDate and status='scheduled'
   ‚Üí Calendar page shows hollow ring indicator
   ```

2. **Completing a Workout**:
   ```
   User selects past/current date ‚Üí Library page calls /api/workouts/[id]/complete
   ‚Üí DynamoDB updates workout with completedDate and status='completed'
   ‚Üí Calendar page shows filled dot/badge
   ‚Üí Streak calculation triggered
   ```

3. **Calendar Display**:
   ```
   Calendar page loads ‚Üí Fetches all workouts + scheduled workouts from DynamoDB
   ‚Üí Separates into markedDates (completed) and scheduledDates (scheduled)
   ‚Üí Calendar component renders visual indicators
   ‚Üí Selected date shows combined list with status badges
   ```

### DynamoDB Query Patterns

1. **Get all user workouts**: `userId = :userId` (existing)
2. **Get scheduled workouts**: `userId = :userId AND attribute_exists(scheduledDate)`
3. **Get workouts for specific date**: `userId = :userId AND scheduledDate = :date`

**Note**: These use filter expressions on existing table. For high-scale production, consider adding a GSI on `scheduledDate` for more efficient queries.

### Backward Compatibility

- Workouts without `status` field are treated as completed (legacy behavior)
- Workouts without `completedDate` fall back to `createdAt` for display
- Existing workouts continue to work without modification

## üöÄ What's Next (Phase 3+)

### Deferred Features
- **Drag-and-drop scheduling**: Would require more complex calendar component
- **Workout reminders/notifications**: Requires Amazon SNS setup
- **Week/day views**: Calendar currently supports month view only
- **Recurring workouts**: Would need additional scheduling patterns

### Future Enhancements
- Smart workout suggestions based on schedule gaps
- Rest day recommendations
- Training plan templates with pre-scheduled workouts
- Calendar export (ICS format) for external calendar apps

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **No GSI for scheduledDate**: Using filter expressions for now. Add GSI if query performance becomes an issue.
2. **No notifications**: Users must manually check calendar for scheduled workouts.
3. **No recurring schedules**: Each workout must be scheduled individually.
4. **No drag-and-drop**: Scheduling requires clicking through date picker.
