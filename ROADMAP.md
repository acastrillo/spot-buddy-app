## Immediate Next Steps

Based on current status, the recommended next phase is:

### **Phase 1: Core Data Persistence** (START HERE)
This is the foundation for all other features. Without workout data syncing to DynamoDB:
- Users can't access workouts across devices
- Data only exists in browser localStorage
- No analytics or progress tracking possible

**Action Items**:
1. Design workout DynamoDB schema
2. Implement workout CRUD operations
3. Update UI pages to use DynamoDB
4. Test cross-device sync

Once Phase 1 is complete, we can move to Phase 2 (Instagram Integration) or Phase 3 (Analytics) based on priorities.
