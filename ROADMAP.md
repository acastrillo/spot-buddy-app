## Quick Wins üéØ

4. **Implement dark/light mode toggle** (currently dark only) (1 hour)
5. **Add workout export to calendar (ICS)** (1 hour)
6. **Create privacy policy and terms of service pages** (2 hours)
7. **Add user feedback widget** (30 min)
8. **Implement workout search and filters** (2 hours)

## Immediate Next Steps

Based on current status, the recommended next phase is:

### **Phase 1: Core Data Persistence** (START HERE)
This is the foundation for all other features. Without workout data syncing to DynamoDB:
- Users can't access workouts across devices
- Data only exists in browser localStorage
- No analytics or progress tracking possible

**Action Items**:
1. Design workout DynamoDB schema
2. Implement workout CRUD operations
3. Update UI pages to use DynamoDB
4. Test cross-device sync

Once Phase 1 is complete, we can move to Phase 2 (Instagram Integration) or Phase 3 (Analytics) based on priorities.
