## 📝 POST VARIATIONS

### Post 1: Fitness Community/Group Post

**Target Audience**: Fitness Facebook groups, communities, forums

```
Hey fitness fam! 👋

I've been building something for the past 6 months that I wish existed when I started lifting. Would love your feedback.

THE PROBLEM I'M SOLVING:

You see an awesome workout on Instagram from your favorite fitness influencer. You screenshot it. Fast forward 2 weeks... you have 200+ workout screenshots and can't find the one you wanted. Sound familiar?

WHAT I BUILT:

Spot Buddy - An AI-powered fitness tracker that:

✅ Scans your Instagram workout screenshots using OCR
✅ Automatically organizes and cleans them up
✅ Generates custom workouts using AI ("upper body dumbbells, 45 min" → full workout in 3 seconds)
✅ Tracks all your PRs with 7 different 1RM calculation formulas
✅ Shows real progress with charts and analytics
✅ Includes smart timers (HIIT, Interval, Rest)

TECH STACK (for those who care):
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- AWS Bedrock AI (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- DynamoDB for data sync
- AWS Textract + Tesseract.js for OCR
- Deployed on AWS ECS

Already live at spotter.cannashieldct.com - you can try it right now.

I'M LOOKING FOR 10 BETA TESTERS:

Ideal if you:
- Follow fitness influencers on Instagram
- Screenshot workouts regularly
- Want to actually track your progress
- Are willing to give honest, constructive feedback

What you get:
🎁 Unlimited access to everything (AI, OCR, tracking)
💎 50% lifetime discount when we officially launch
⚡ Direct access to me (the founder) for feature requests
🏆 Real input on the product roadmap

What I need from you:
- 2 weeks of real-world testing
- Honest feedback (bugs, UX issues, feature ideas)
- Weekly check-in (15 min call or async feedback)

WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT:

There are workout trackers (Strong, Hevy). There are AI coaches (Future, Caliber at $100+/month). But nothing combines:
1. Instagram screenshot scanning
2. AI workout generation & enhancement
3. Complete progress tracking
4. Smart timers & body metrics

All in one app. All for way less than traditional AI coaching.

SOME REAL TALK:

This is a beta. There will be bugs. Some features might be rough around the edges. But I'm committed to fixing issues fast and building what YOU actually need.

I'm a solo founder building in public. Your feedback will directly shape where this goes.

Interested? Comment "BETA" below or DM me. I'll send you details.

Questions? Drop them in the comments - happy to answer anything about features, tech, pricing, whatever.

Thanks for reading! 🙏

### Post 2: Personal Profile/Network Post

**Target Audience**: Personal Facebook friends, professional network, startup community

```
🚀 Launching my first beta test! Need 10 fitness enthusiasts to help me test something I've been building.

SIX MONTHS AGO, I HAD A FRUSTRATING PROBLEM:

I'd save Instagram workouts from trainers I follow... then never find them again. Buried under hundreds of screenshots. Anyone else?

So I built Spot Buddy to solve it.

WHAT IT DOES:

🤖 AI Workout Generation
Type "chest and triceps, 30 minutes" → get a complete workout in seconds
Powered by AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

📸 OCR Screenshot Scanning
Save Instagram workouts → app scans and organizes them automatically
No more lost screenshots

📊 Progress Tracking That Actually Works
- Personal Records with 7 different 1RM formulas
- Body metrics tracking
- Volume trends and analytics
- Calendar scheduling
- HIIT and interval timers

THE TECH:
- Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- AWS infrastructure (Bedrock, DynamoDB, Textract, ECS)
- Full offline support
- Dark theme (because we gym at night 😎)

Already live: spotter.cannashieldct.com

NOW I NEED BETA TESTERS:

Perfect if you:
✓ Work out 3-4+ times per week
✓ Follow fitness content on Instagram
✓ Want better progress tracking
✓ Like trying new tech/apps
✓ Can give honest feedback

You'll get:
🎁 Free unlimited access (normally $14/month)
💎 50% off for life after launch
📱 Early access to mobile apps (Android coming next!)
🎯 Direct line to me for feature requests

I need:
- 2 weeks of testing (Jan 6-20)
- Real-world usage feedback
- Bug reports if you find any
- Ideas for improvements

THE VISION:

Everyone has a different gym setup (dumbbells, barbell, machines, bodyweight). Everyone has different goals (strength, hypertrophy, conditioning). Current fitness apps are one-size-fits-all.

Spot Buddy uses AI to generate workouts based on YOUR equipment, YOUR goals, YOUR fitness level. And it learns from your workout history to get better over time.

This beta helps me make sure I'm building the right thing.

WHY I'M BUILDING IN PUBLIC:

I could spend another 6 months polishing features. Or I could get it in the hands of real users now and build what they actually need.

I'm choosing the latter.

If you're interested or know someone who might be, comment below or send me a message. Happy to answer any questions!

And if you've built or launched a product before - would love any advice on running a beta test! 🙏

P.S. - Special shoutout to [tag any tech friends who helped] for the feedback during development. Wouldn't be here without you!
