We've been building something we wish existed 6 months ago. 💪

You know that feeling when you see an incredible workout on Instagram, screenshot it, and then... never find it again? Buried under 300+ screenshots of workouts you'll "definitely do later"?

We built Spot Buddy to solve that. Here's what makes it different:

🎯 2-Tap Save → Scan Instagram workout screenshots with OCR
🤖 AI That Gets You → "Upper body dumbbells, 45 min" → Full workout generated
📊 Track Everything → Workouts, PRs, body metrics, progress charts
⏱️ Smart Timers → HIIT, Interval, Rest timers built-in
📈 Real Analytics → Volume trends, muscle group distribution, actual progress

We're opening up 10 beta test spots this week. Looking for fitness enthusiasts who:
- Save Instagram workouts regularly
- Want to actually track their progress
- Are willing to give honest feedback
- Love trying new tech

Beta Tester Perks:
✓ Unlimited access to all features (including AI)
✓ 50% lifetime discount when we launch
✓ Direct line to the founder (me!)
✓ Shape the product roadmap

This isn't just another workout tracker. It's the only app that combines Instagram import + AI coaching + comprehensive tracking in one place.
