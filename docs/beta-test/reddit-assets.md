### Post 1: r/Fitness - Feedback Request

**Subreddit**: r/Fitness
**Flair**: \[Discussion\] or \[App/Website\] (check subreddit rules)
**Title**: "Built a workout tracker that scans Instagram screenshots with OCR - looking for honest feedback"

```
Hey r/Fitness,

I've been working on a fitness tracking app for the past 6 months and would love your honest feedback before officially launching.

**The Problem I'm Solving:**

I follow a bunch of fitness influencers on Instagram. I'd screenshot their workouts thinking "I'll try this later." Fast forward 2 weeks... I have 200+ screenshots and can't find anything.

Figured I couldn't be the only one with this problem.

**What I Built:**

Spot Buddy - a workout tracker with a few key features:

1. **OCR Screenshot Scanning**
   - Take a screenshot of an Instagram workout
   - App scans it using AWS Textract + Tesseract.js
   - Automatically extracts exercises, sets, reps, weights
   - Saves it to your organized library

2. **AI Workout Generation**
   - Type: "upper body with dumbbells, 45 minutes"
   - Get a complete workout in ~3 seconds
   - Powered by AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
   - Adapts to your equipment and goals

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - 7 different 1RM calculation formulas
   - Personal Records tracking
   - Body metrics (weight, BF%, measurements)
   - Volume trends and analytics charts
   - Calendar scheduling

4. **Smart Timers**
   - Interval timer (1-60 min customizable)
   - HIIT timer with presets (Tabata, EMOM, etc.)
   - Floating rest timer widget

**Tech Stack** (if you care):
- Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- AWS Bedrock, DynamoDB, Textract, ECS
- Dark theme, mobile-first
- Offline support with LocalStorage
- Already deployed: [spotter.cannashieldct.com](https://spotter.cannashieldct.com)

**Current Status:**

Phase 1-6 complete (all core features + AI integration done as of Dec 26). Now I need real-world testing before Android/iOS apps.

**What I'm Looking For:**

10 beta testers willing to:
- Use it for 2 weeks (Jan 6-20)
- Give honest feedback (what sucks, what's missing, bugs)
- Test the OCR and AI features with real workouts
- Tell me if this actually solves a problem or if I'm off base

**What You Get:**
- Unlimited access (AI, OCR, everything)
- 50% lifetime discount if you stick around after beta
- Direct line to me for feature requests
- Input on roadmap

**Questions for r/Fitness:**

1. Is the "Instagram screenshot problem" actually a thing, or just me?
2. Would you use OCR scanning, or is manual entry fine?
3. AI workout generation - useful or gimmicky?
4. What features am I missing that would make this actually worth using?
5. What workout tracker do you currently use, and what do you wish it did better?

**Being Honest:**

I'm a solo dev, not a big company. There will be bugs. Some UX might be rough. But I'm committed to fixing issues fast and building what lifters actually need, not what I *think* you need.

Happy to answer any questions about features, tech, pricing, whatever.

Thanks for reading!

---

**Edit 1**: Wow, didn't expect this much response! Reading every comment and taking notes. Common questions:

- "Can it handle Olympic lifts?" → Yes, OCR recognizes standard exercises. AI generates Olympic lift workouts if you specify.
- "Pricing after beta?" → $8.99/mo (Core tier) or $69.99/year. Beta testers get 50% off for life.
- "iOS/Android timeline?" → Android app is next priority (native Kotlin, 2-3 months). iOS after that.
- "Privacy/data?" → All data stored in your own DynamoDB partition. No selling data, no ads. End-to-end AWS security.

**Edit 2**: For those asking about beta test - comment "BETA" below or DM me. I'll send details. Closing when I hit 10 testers.
```

### Post 2: r/SideProject - Beta Recruitment

**Subreddit**: r/SideProject
**Flair**: \[Feedback\] or \[Looking for Beta Testers\]
**Title**: "6 months of solo dev: AI-powered fitness tracker with Instagram OCR - need 10 beta testers"

```
**Project**: Spot Buddy - AI Fitness Tracker
**URL**: [spotter.cannashieldct.com](https://spotter.cannashieldct.com)
**Timeline**: 6 months (Jun 2025 - Dec 2025)
**Stack**: Next.js 15, AWS Bedrock, DynamoDB, TypeScript
**Status**: Phase 6 complete, beta testing before mobile apps

---

## TL;DR

Built a fitness app that scans Instagram workout screenshots with OCR, generates custom workouts with AI (AWS Bedrock), and tracks your complete training progress. Need 10 beta testers willing to use it for 2 weeks and give honest feedback.

---

## The Problem

Fitness influencers post great workouts on Instagram. You screenshot them. Then you have 200+ screenshots and can't find anything. Current workout trackers (Strong, Hevy) don't solve this - they expect manual entry.

---

## The Solution

**Spot Buddy** combines three things that don't exist together:

1. **Instagram Screenshot Scanning (OCR)**
   - Scan workout screenshots from any source
   - AWS Textract + Tesseract.js extracts exercises, sets, reps
   - Cleans up messy formatting
   - Auto-saves to organized library

2. **AI Workout Generation**
   - Natural language: "chest and triceps, dumbbells only, 30 minutes"
   - AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 4.5) generates complete workout
   - Considers your equipment, goals, fitness level
   - Cost: ~$0.02 per generation

3. **Complete Progress Tracking**
   - 7 different 1RM formulas for PRs
   - Body metrics tracking
   - Volume trends, muscle group distribution charts
   - Calendar scheduling, completion tracking
   - HIIT/Interval/Rest timers built-in

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19, TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Offline: LocalStorage

**Backend:**
- Next.js API routes
- NextAuth.js + AWS Cognito
- Prisma ORM (dev), DynamoDB (prod)

**AWS Infrastructure:**
- Bedrock (AI - Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Textract (OCR)
- DynamoDB (database)
- ECS Fargate (hosting)
- CloudWatch (monitoring)

**Payments:**
- Stripe integration (4 tiers: Free, Core, Pro, Elite)

**Deployment:**
- Docker
- AWS ECS + ALB
- Route53 DNS

---

## Features Complete

**Phase 1-2** (Jul-Aug): Core CRUD, authentication, offline support
**Phase 3** (Sep): Calendar, scheduling, workout completion
**Phase 4** (Oct): PR tracking, body metrics, analytics
**Phase 5** (Nov): Stripe integration, subscription tiers
**Phase 6** (Dec): AI workout enhancement, generation, Workout of the Day

All phases = 100% complete as of Dec 26, 2025.

---

## What I'm Looking For

**10 Beta Testers** (Jan 6-20, 2 weeks):

Ideal tester:
- Works out 3-4+ times per week
- Follows fitness influencers / screenshots workouts
- Willing to test OCR and AI features thoroughly
- Can give honest, constructive feedback

You get:
- Unlimited access (admin privileges, bypass all quotas)
- 50% lifetime discount ($4.49/mo instead of $8.99)
- Direct access to me for bugs/features
- Real input on roadmap

I need:
- Real-world usage (not just poking around)
- Feedback: bugs, UX issues, missing features
- Weekly async update (5-10 min)

---

## Business Model

**Subscription Tiers** (live on Stripe):
- **Free**: 3 workouts/week, 1 AI request/month, 90-day history
- **Core**: $8.99/mo - Unlimited workouts, 10 AI/month
- **Pro**: $13.99/mo - 30 AI/month, advanced analytics
- **Elite**: $24.99/mo - 100 AI/month, crew features

**Unit Economics:**
- AWS fixed: ~$40-60/month
- AI per request: $0.01-0.02 (Bedrock)
- OCR per scan: $0.03-0.05 (Textract)
- Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30

Break-even: 39 paid Core users

---

## Roadmap

**Next** (Q1 2026):
- Android app (Kotlin, native Instagram share sheet integration)
- iOS app (Swift)
- Workout marketplace (user-created plans)

**Future**:
- Enhanced crew/social features
- Coach platform for trainers
- API for third-party integrations

---

## Lessons Learned

**What went well:**
- Next.js 15 App Router is amazing for this use case
- AWS Bedrock cheaper than OpenAI (Claude Sonnet 4.5: ~$0.015 per 1K tokens)
- DynamoDB perfect for user partitioning
- shadcn/ui sped up UI development 10x

**What was hard:**
- OCR accuracy varies wildly (handwritten workouts are tough)
- Workout data modeling is complex (AMRAP, supersets, drop sets, etc.)
- AI prompts required 20+ iterations to get workout quality right
- Balancing feature richness vs. simplicity (nearly over-engineered)

**What I'd do differently:**
- Ship earlier (spent too long perfecting before getting user feedback)
- Focus on mobile from day 1 (web is fine, but mobile is where users are)
- More aggressive quota limits on free tier (prevent abuse)

## Why I'm Posting Here

r/SideProject has been hugely helpful during development. I've lurked here for 6 months, learned from your feedback posts, and now I need your help to make sure I'm building the right thing.

If you're interested in beta testing, comment "BETA" or DM me. I'll send details.

If you just want to roast my tech choices or ask about implementation, fire away - happy to discuss anything.

Thanks for reading!

---

**Comments I'm expecting (and answers):**

**"Why not just use Strong/Hevy?"**
They're great for manual entry. But neither has Instagram OCR or AI generation. If you're happy manual entering, stick with them. This is for people who want to save + organize Instagram workouts.

**"AI workout generation is gimmicky"**
Fair critique. I thought so too initially. But after using it for 3 months, I use it 2-3x per week when I want variety or don't have a planned workout. It's a tool, not a replacement for programming.

**"How do you compete with free apps?"**
I'm not trying to be free. I'm trying to be worth $9/month. If AI + OCR + comprehensive tracking saves you 10 hours/month of workout planning, it pays for itself.

**"This sounds like feature bloat"**
Possibly. That's why I need beta testers. If 80% of value is in 20% of features, I'll simplify. But I won't know until real users tell me.

**"What's your moat?"**
Instagram OCR + AI integration is unique right now. Android/iOS apps with native share sheet will be the real differentiator (2-tap save from Instagram). But honestly, moat = execution and speed.

- Docker (deployment)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD ready)
```

---

## Architecture Decisions & Why

### 1. Next.js 15 App Router vs. Pages

**Chose**: App Router

**Why:**
- Server Components = reduced client bundle
- Streaming with Suspense for AI requests
- Server Actions for mutations (cleaner than API routes for simple CRUD)
- Better DX with layouts and parallel routes

**Trade-offs:**
- Steeper learning curve
- Some ecosystem libs still Pages-focused
- More opinionated structure

**Would I do it again?** Yes. App Router feels more modern and the DX is better once you grok the mental model.

---

### 2. DynamoDB vs. PostgreSQL/MySQL

**Chose**: DynamoDB (with Prisma + SQLite for local dev)

**Why:**
- Perfect for user partitioning (partition key = userId)
- Serverless scaling (don't need to manage RDS)
- Low latency reads/writes
- Pay-per-request pricing = cheap at low scale

**Trade-offs:**
- No complex joins (had to denormalize data)
- Local dev requires DynamoDB Local or SQLite
- Query patterns must be designed upfront
- Prisma migrations don't work (manual DynamoDB table setup)

**Would I do it again?** Yes for this use case. But if I needed complex relational queries, I'd use Postgres + Supabase.

---

### 3. AWS Bedrock vs. OpenAI API

**Chose**: AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

**Why:**
- Cheaper ($0.003 per 1K input tokens vs OpenAI's $0.005+)
- Already on AWS infrastructure (simpler auth)
- Claude is better at structured output (workout formatting)
- No need for separate API key management

**Trade-offs:**
- Region availability (must use us-east-1 for Claude)
- Newer service (less community support)
- Rate limits less clear than OpenAI

**Cost comparison** (1,000 AI workout generations):
- Bedrock: ~$20
- OpenAI GPT-4: ~$30-40

**Would I do it again?** Absolutely. Bedrock + Claude is underrated.

---

### 4. Tailwind + shadcn/ui vs. Material-UI/Chakra

**Chose**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

**Why:**
- Full design control (no MUI bloat)
- shadcn = copy-paste components (no package dependency)
- Tailwind = fast iteration
- Easy dark mode with CSS variables
- Smaller bundle size

**Trade-offs:**
- More initial setup (design system from scratch)
- No built-in form components (used React Hook Form separately)

**Would I do it again?** Yes. shadcn/ui is a game-changer for side projects.

---

### 5. Stripe vs. Build Your Own Payments

**Chose**: Stripe

**Why:**
- PCI compliance handled
- Webhooks for subscription management
- Customer portal out of the box
- Solid Next.js integration
- Test mode for development

**Trade-offs:**
- 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (not cheap)
- Some webhook edge cases are tricky
- Subscription tier changes require careful logic

**Would I do it again?** 100%. Never build your own payments.

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: OCR Accuracy on Handwritten Workouts

**Problem**: AWS Textract works great on typed text, terrible on handwritten workout screenshots.

**Solution**:
- Dual OCR: Textract (server) + Tesseract.js (client fallback)
- AI enhancement layer: Claude cleans up messy OCR output
- User can manually edit after scan

**Lesson**: OCR is not 100%. Always give users escape hatch to fix errors.

---

### Challenge 2: Workout Data Modeling (Complex!)

**Problem**: Workouts have infinite variety:
- Standard sets (3x10)
- Supersets
- Drop sets
- AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)
- Timed circuits
- Pyramid sets

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Flexible JSON structure in DynamoDB
type Workout = {
  id: string
  userId: string
  name: string
  exercises: Array<{
    name: string
    sets?: number
    reps?: number | string  // "10" or "AMRAP" or "to failure"
    weight?: number
    duration?: number  // for timed exercises
    restSeconds?: number
    notes?: string
    type?: 'standard' | 'superset' | 'circuit' | 'amrap'
  }>
  workoutType: 'standard' | 'amrap' | 'circuit'
  metadata: Record<string, any>  // extensible for future workout types
}
```

**Lesson**: Don't over-normalize. Embrace JSON flexibility in DynamoDB.

---

### Challenge 3: AI Prompt Engineering (20+ Iterations)

**Problem**: Getting Claude to generate *good* workouts required precise prompting.

**What didn't work**:
- Generic "generate a workout" → too random, no structure
- Over-specified prompts → too rigid, not adaptive
- No examples → inconsistent formatting

**What worked**:
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are a certified personal trainer with expertise in strength training, hypertrophy, and functional fitness...
[150 lines of detailed instructions with examples]
`

const userPrompt = `Generate a workout based on:
Equipment: ${equipment}
Duration: ${duration} minutes
Goals: ${goals}
Experience level: ${level}

Return as JSON: { warmup: [...], exercises: [...], cooldown: [...] }`
```

**Lesson**: AI quality = prompt quality. Invest time here.

---

### Challenge 4: Offline Support + Online Sync

**Problem**: Users want to track workouts at the gym (no signal). Data must sync when back online.

**Solution**:
- LocalStorage for offline writes
- Background sync on reconnect
- Conflict resolution (last-write-wins for now)
- Optimistic UI updates

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Offline write
localStorage.setItem(`workout_${workoutId}`, JSON.stringify(workout))

// Background sync on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const syncOfflineWorkouts = async () => {
    const keys = Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith('workout_'))
    for (const key of keys) {
      const workout = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key))
      await fetch('/api/workouts', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(workout) })
      localStorage.removeItem(key)
    }
  }
  syncOfflineWorkouts()
}, [])
```

**Lesson**: Offline-first is hard. Start simple (LocalStorage), iterate to IndexedDB if needed.

---
