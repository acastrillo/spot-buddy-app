### What We're Looking For

✅ **Honest feedback** - Tell us what's broken, confusing, or missing

✅ **Bug reports** - If something doesn't work, we need to know
✅ **Feature ideas** - What would make this invaluable to you?

❌ **Not looking for** - Politeness over honesty, surface-level "looks good!", one-time logins

### Your Impact

Your feedback will:
