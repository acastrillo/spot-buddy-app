## How to Invoke Agents

When working with Claude Code, you can request a specialized agent by:

1. **Explicitly asking for them:**
   - "Let's use the nextjs-developer agent to optimize this page"
   - "Can the security-reviewer audit this authentication flow?"

2. **Describing the task type:**
   - Claude will automatically select appropriate agents based on context
   - E.g., "Fix these TypeScript errors" → typescript-pro
   - E.g., "Improve this component's performance" → react-specialist

3. **Complex tasks may involve multiple agents:**
   - Claude will coordinate agent handoffs automatically
   - E.g., "Build a new feature" might involve business-analyst → ui-designer → nextjs-developer → security-reviewer

---

## Agent Files

Each agent has a detailed persona file in `docs/agents/`:

- `nextjs-developer-agent.md` - Next.js development specialist
- `react-specialist-agent.md` - React patterns and optimization
- `typescript-pro.md` - TypeScript development expert *(Note: filename has typo: `typesccript-agent.md`)*
- `business-analyst.md` - Business logic and requirements
- `ui-designer.md` - UI/UX design guidance
- `ux-researcher.md` - User experience research
- `security-reviewer.md` - Security audit and compliance
- `fitness-branding-strategist.md` - Brand and marketing strategy

---

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent focuses on their area of expertise
2. **Clear Handoffs**: Agents communicate requirements clearly when collaborating
3. **Context Sharing**: All agents have access to project documentation
4. **Quality Focus**: Each agent maintains high standards in their domain
5. **User-Centric**: All agents prioritize user needs and experience

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use multiple agents at once?**
A: Yes! Complex tasks often require multiple agents working together. Claude will coordinate the collaboration.

**Q: How do I know which agent to use?**
A: Describe your task naturally. If you're not sure, Claude will select the appropriate agent(s) based on context.

**Q: Can agents work on tasks outside their specialty?**
A: Agents can provide general guidance, but they excel in their areas of expertise. For best results, use the specialist agent for specialized tasks.

**Q: What if I need help with something not covered by these agents?**
A: Claude Code can handle general tasks without specialized agents. These agents are for when you need deep expertise in specific areas.
