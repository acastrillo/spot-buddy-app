# Ready to Test - Summary

## ✅ Pre-Test Verification Complete

All major components have been verified and the deployment is **READY FOR TESTING**.

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Duplicate User Bug - ✅ DEPLOYED

**Root Cause:** PrismaAdapter was creating new users on every OAuth sign-in

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Removed PrismaAdapter from [auth-options.ts:187](src/lib/auth-options.ts#L187)
- ✅ Added signIn callback that checks DynamoDB by email BEFORE creating ([auth-options.ts:242-291](src/lib/auth-options.ts#L242-L291))
- ✅ Reuses existing user ID if found, only creates new UUID for truly new users
- ✅ Deployed to production at 14:28:40 EST

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ ECS Service: ACTIVE
- ✅ Running Tasks: 1/1
- ✅ Deployment: COMPLETED
- ✅ App URL: https://spotter.cannashieldct.com (HTTP 200)

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues Found

### Issue 1: EmailProvider Disabled (Minor - Does NOT Affect OAuth Testing)

**What:** EmailProvider (magic link login) is non-functional without an adapter

**Error in Logs:**
```
[next-auth][error][EMAIL_REQUIRES_ADAPTER_ERROR]
E-mail login requires an adapter.
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Email magic link login will not work
- ✅ Google OAuth works fine
- ✅ Facebook OAuth works fine
- ✅ Dev credentials (development mode) work fine

**Cause:** We removed PrismaAdapter (which was causing duplicates), but EmailProvider needs an adapter to store verification tokens

**Fix Options:**
1. **Remove EmailProvider** from auth-options.ts (recommended - focus on OAuth)
2. **Add custom adapter** for EmailProvider later if needed
3. **Leave as-is** - OAuth is primary auth method anyway

**Recommendation:** Proceed with OAuth testing. Email login can be addressed later if needed.

### Issue 2: Missing stripeCustomerId-index GSI (Important - Affects Performance)

**What:** DynamoDB table is missing the `stripeCustomerId-index` Global Secondary Index

**Current State:**
- ✅ email-index: ACTIVE
- ⚠️ stripeCustomerId-index: MISSING

**Impact:**
- Webhooks fall back to email lookup (slower but functional)
- Performance degradation for subscription events
- Auto-linking of stripeCustomerId less optimal

**Fix:**
```bash
node scripts/create-stripe-customer-gsi.mjs
```

**Time:** 5-10 minutes (table remains usable during creation)

**Priority:** High - Should create before production load, but testing can proceed without it

## 🚀 Ready to Test - Action Items

### Immediate (Before Testing):

1. **Create stripeCustomerId-index GSI** (5-10 min):
   ```bash
   node scripts/create-stripe-customer-gsi.mjs
   ```
   While waiting, you can proceed with steps 2-3.

2. **Verify Stripe Webhook Configured:**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
   - Confirm endpoint: `https://spotter.cannashieldct.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Required events:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `customer.subscription.created`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`
     - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
     - `invoice.payment_failed`

3. **Clear Browser State:**
   - Sign out from https://spotter.cannashieldct.com
   - Clear cookies for cannashieldct.com domain
   - Close all browser tabs

### Testing Phase:

4. **Run Health Check:**
   ```bash
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/health-check.ps1
   ```

5. **Phase 1: Single User Test**
   - Sign in with Google or Facebook OAuth
   - Verify only ONE user created:
     ```bash
     node scripts/verify-single-user.mjs
     ```
   - Sign out and sign in again
   - Verify SAME user ID (no duplicates):
     ```bash
     node scripts/verify-single-user.mjs
     ```

6. **Phase 2: Subscription Test**
   - Go to Settings
   - Upgrade to Pro or Elite
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Wait for redirect + 5 seconds
   - Verify tier shows correctly in UI
   - Verify database updated:
     ```bash
     node scripts/verify-single-user.mjs your-email@example.com
     ```

7. **Phase 3: Webhook Verification**
   - Check logs for successful webhook processing:
     ```bash
     aws logs tail /ecs/spotter-app --region us-east-1 --since 5m --filter-pattern "Webhook:evt_"
     ```

### Optional (During Testing):

8. **Monitor Logs in Real-Time:**
   ```bash
   aws logs tail /ecs/spotter-app --region us-east-1 --follow --filter-pattern "Auth:SignIn OR Auth:JWT OR Webhook"
   ```

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

After testing, you should see:

- ✅ Only ONE user per email in DynamoDB
- ✅ Same user ID across sign-in/sign-out cycles
- ✅ Subscription upgrade sticks to single user
- ✅ UI reflects correct tier
- ✅ Logs show `[Auth:SignIn] ✓ Existing user found` on repeat logins
- ✅ Webhooks show `Successfully updated user <uuid> subscription`
- ✅ No "User not found" errors

---

## 🔧 Available Tools

## 🎬 You're Ready!

The duplicate user fix is **DEPLOYED and READY FOR TESTING**.

**Current blockers:** NONE (EmailProvider issue doesn't affect OAuth)

**Recommended before testing:** Create stripeCustomerId-index GSI (5-10 min)

**Can start testing immediately?** YES - OAuth works, database is clean, Stripe is configured

---

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Duplicate users still being created:

Check [auth-options.ts:242](src/lib/auth-options.ts#L242) signIn callback is running:
```bash
aws logs tail /ecs/spotter-app --region us-east-1 --filter-pattern "Auth:SignIn"
```

Should see either:
- `[Auth:SignIn] ✓ Existing user found for <email>`
- `[Auth:SignIn] ✓ Creating new user for <email>`

### Subscription not sticking:

Check webhook logs:
```bash
aws logs tail /ecs/spotter-app --region us-east-1 --filter-pattern "Webhook:evt_"
```

Look for "Successfully updated user" vs errors

### Need to reset:

```bash
# Delete all users and start fresh
node scripts/delete-all-users.mjs --confirm

# Clear browser state
# Sign out + clear cookies + close tabs
```
