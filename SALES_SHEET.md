## 📋 FAQ for Sales Conversations

**Q: How is this different from [competitor]?**
A: We're the only app that combines AI workout generation with Instagram importing. Plus, our AI is powered by Claude (Anthropic), the most advanced fitness-aware AI available.

---

**Q: Can I really get results without a human trainer?**
A: Yes! 80% of what a trainer provides is programming and accountability—both of which AI excels at. For the other 20% (technique refinement, motivation), our Elite tier includes monthly human consultations.

---

**Q: What if I don't like it?**
A: Cancel anytime, no questions asked. We're confident you'll love it, but if not, we offer prorated refunds within 30 days.

---

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Absolutely. We use bank-level encryption (AWS), never share your data, and are SOC 2 compliant (in progress). Your workouts and progress are private by default.

---

**Q: Do you have a mobile app?**
A: Web app works great on mobile browsers now. Native Android app launching Q2 2026, iOS Q4 2026.

---

**Q: Can I import workouts from sources other than Instagram?**
A: Yes! Upload images (OCR), paste text, or generate from scratch with AI. Instagram is just one option.

---

**Q: What equipment do I need?**
A: None! You can use bodyweight only, or tell the AI what equipment you have available. It adapts to YOU.

---

**Q: Is this for beginners or advanced lifters?**
A: Both! You set your experience level, and the AI adjusts difficulty accordingly. We have everyone from first-timers to competitive powerlifters.

---

**Q: How does AI know what workout to create for me?**
A: You create a training profile (experience, goals, equipment, schedule), and the AI uses that + your workout history to generate personalized programs. It gets smarter the more you use it.

---

**Q: Can I share workouts with friends?**
A: Coming soon! For now, you can manually share workout details, but we're building native sharing features.
