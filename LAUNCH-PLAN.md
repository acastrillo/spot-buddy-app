## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low user adoption
- **Mitigation**: Leverage existing network, gym partnerships, Reddit/social media
- **Contingency**: Extend beta period, gather more feedback

### Risk 2: Technical issues during launch
- **Mitigation**: Load testing, monitoring dashboards, on-call developer
- **Contingency**: Scale down features temporarily, roll back deployment

### Risk 3: Crew features unused
- **Mitigation**: Onboarding flow emphasizes crew invites, provide example quips
- **Contingency**: Pivot to focus on individual progress tracking

### Risk 4: Missing New Year window
- **Mitigation**: Tight 2-3 week development sprint, daily standups
- **Contingency**: Launch without crew features, add in January
