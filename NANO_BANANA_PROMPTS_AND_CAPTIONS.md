Let's do the math real quick 🧮

Most personal trainers: $100/session
Train 4x/month = $400/month = $4,800/year

Kinex Fit Pro: $19.99/month = $240/year

YOU SAVE: $4,560 PER YEAR 💰

And honestly? You might get BETTER results because:

✅ You can train MORE (not limited to 4 sessions)
✅ You can train WHENEVER (not just when your trainer is free)
✅ You get VARIETY (unlimited AI workouts vs. same routine)
✅ You build INDEPENDENCE (learn to program for yourself)

Don't get me wrong—personal trainers are valuable for technique coaching and accountability.

But for workout programming? AI does it just as well for 95% less money.

That's $4,560 you can spend on:
- Better gym membership ✅
- Quality supplements ✅
- Proper workout gear ✅
- Healthy meal prep ✅
- Vacation after your transformation ✅

Or just... save it.

TOTAL: $550/month

AFTER:
• Gym membership: $50 ✅
• Kinex Fit AI Coach: $20 ✅

And honestly? The AI workouts are BETTER because:
✅ Unlimited variety (not the same 3 workouts)
✅ Available 24/7 (not just 4 hours/month)
✅ Personalized to MY equipment and goals
✅ I can train whenever I want

That's $5,760 I can spend on:
• Better gym
• Quality supplements
• New gear
• Vacation after hitting my goals
• Or just... save it

Personal trainers are great for technique and accountability. But for programming? AI does it just as well for 95% less money.
