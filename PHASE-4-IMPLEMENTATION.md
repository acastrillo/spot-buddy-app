# Phase 4 Implementation: Enhanced Stats & PRs Tracking

**Completion Date**: November 3, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Time Spent**: ~3 hours

## Overview

Phase 4 adds comprehensive exercise tracking, personal record (PR) management, and body weight logging capabilities to Spot Buddy. This phase transforms the app from basic workout tracking into a full-featured strength training companion with intelligent progress tracking.

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 4.1 Exercise History & Analysis ‚úÖ

**File**: [src/lib/exercise-history.ts](src/lib/exercise-history.ts)

- Extract exercises from workouts for detailed analysis
- Calculate volume, frequency, and averages per exercise
- Categorize exercises by muscle group (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Arms, Legs, Core)
- Track exercise performance over time
- Get volume distribution by muscle group

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
extractExercisesFromWorkout(workout: DynamoDBWorkout): WorkoutExercise[]
getExerciseHistory(workouts: DynamoDBWorkout[], exerciseName: string): WorkoutExercise[]
getVolumeByMuscleGroup(workouts: DynamoDBWorkout[]): Record<string, number>
categorizeExerciseByMuscleGroup(exerciseName: string): string
```

### 4.2 PR Calculator & 1RM Estimates ‚úÖ

**File**: [src/lib/pr-calculator.ts](src/lib/pr-calculator.ts)

- **Brzycki Formula**: 1RM = weight / (1.0278 - 0.0278 √ó reps)
- **Epley Formula**: 1RM = weight √ó (1 + reps / 30)
- Automatic PR detection across all workouts
- Weight parsing with unit support (lbs/kg)
- Weight normalization for cross-unit comparison
- Volume load calculations (weight √ó reps)

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
calculateOneRepMax(weight: number, reps: number): number
identifyPRs(exercises: WorkoutExercise[]): PR[]
isNewPR(exerciseName, weight, reps, unit, existingPRs): boolean
parseWeight(weightStr: string): { value: number; unit: 'lbs' | 'kg' }
```

**Example Output**:
```typescript
{
  exercise: "Bench Press",
  weight: 225,
  reps: 5,
  estimatedOneRepMax: 253, // Calculated average of Brzycki & Epley
  date: "2025-11-03",
  workoutId: "abc123",
  formula: "brzycki"
}
```

---

## üßÆ Technical Implementation

### 1RM Formula Selection:
- **Brzycki**: More accurate for 1-10 reps
- **Epley**: Good for 1-10 reps, slightly different curve
- **Average**: We use average of both for best estimate
- **Actual**: For 1 rep max, we use the actual weight

### Weight Normalization:
All weights are normalized to lbs for comparison:
```typescript
normalizeWeight(weight: number, unit: 'lbs' | 'kg'): number {
  return unit === 'kg' ? kgToLbs(weight) : weight;
}
```

This ensures PRs are compared fairly regardless of unit used.

### Exercise Categorization:
Simple keyword-based muscle group detection:
- "bench", "chest", "fly" ‚Üí Chest
- "row", "pull", "deadlift", "lat" ‚Üí Back
- "shoulder", "press", "raise", "delt" ‚Üí Shoulders
- "curl", "tricep", "bicep", "extension" ‚Üí Arms
- "squat", "leg", "lunge", "calf" ‚Üí Legs
- "ab", "core", "plank", "crunch" ‚Üí Core
- Default ‚Üí Other

## üìù Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Exercise Name Matching**: Currently case-sensitive and requires exact match
   - **Future**: Implement fuzzy matching or normalization

2. **Body Metrics Table**: Requires manual DynamoDB table creation
   - **Future**: Add CloudFormation/CDK template

3. **PR Detection**: Only checks against existing PRs in current session
   - **Future**: Load all user PRs on app init for real-time detection

4. **Exercise Categorization**: Simple keyword matching
   - **Future**: Use ML or exercise database for accurate categorization

5. **Unit Conversion**: Assumes lbs for charts
   - **Future**: User preference for default unit

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Exercise History**: Queries all workouts, then filters client-side
  - **Impact**: Acceptable for < 1000 workouts
  - **Future**: Add DynamoDB GSI on exercise name

- **PR Calculation**: Recalculated on every page load
  - **Impact**: Minimal for < 100 exercises
  - **Future**: Cache PRs in user profile

- **Chart Data**: Limited to last 90 days (body weight) and 20 sessions (exercise)
  - **Impact**: Keeps chart performant and readable
  - **Future**: Add date range selector

---

## üéì Learning & Insights

1. **1RM Formulas**: Multiple formulas exist, each with strengths
   - Averaging Brzycki and Epley provides best general estimate
   - Less accurate for reps > 12

2. **DynamoDB Sort Keys**: Using composite keys (`type#date`) enables:
   - Efficient range queries
   - Multiple metric types in same table
   - Chronological sorting

3. **Weight Units**: Always normalize for comparison
   - Prevents bugs when users switch units
   - Enables fair PR detection

4. **Exercise Names**: Case sensitivity matters
   - "Bench Press" ‚â† "bench press"
   - Future: normalize on save

---

## üîó Integration Points

### With Existing Features:
- **Dashboard**: Can add PR count widget
- **Library**: Can link to exercise detail pages
- **Add Workout**: Can trigger PR celebration
- **Calendar**: Can show body weight on workout days

### With Future Features:
